<br/>
<span>Dear Sirs,</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<i>The objective and scope of the audit</i>
<br/>
<br/>
<span>You have requested that we audit the financial statements of {{ app.company_name }} {{ app.company_type }} (the “Company”) which comprise the statement of financial position of the Company as at {{ app.financial_year_end|date('d/m/Y') }} and the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows for the year ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies. We are pleased to confirm our acceptance and our understanding of this audit engagement by means of this letter.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span>The objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (SSAs) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>The responsibilities of the auditor</i>
<br/>
<br/>
<span>We will conduct our audit in accordance with SSAs. Those standards require that we comply with ethical requirements. As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:</span>
<ul >
  <li>Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.</li><br/>
  <li>Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. However, we will communicate to you in writing concerning any significant deficiencies in internal control relevant to the audit of the financial statements that we have identified during the audit.</li><br/>
  <li>Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by management.</li><br/>
  <li>Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.</li><br/>
  <li>Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.</li><br/>
</ul>
<br/>
<span>Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, together with the inherent limitations of internal control, there is an unavoidable risk that some material misstatements may not be detected, even though the audit is properly planned and performed in accordance with SSAs.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span>Unless unanticipated difficulties are encountered, our report will be substantially in the following form:</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span>Where necessary, we would be communicating key audit matters in our report. We will discuss such key audit matters with management and those charged with governance before finalising our report.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span>The form and content of our report may need to be amended in the light of our audit findings.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>The responsibilities of management and identification of the applicable financial reporting framework</i>
<br/>
<br/>
<span>Our audit will be conducted on the basis that management and those charged with governance acknowledge and understand that they have responsibility:</span>
<ol type="a" style="margin-left:-120px;">
  <li>For the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1967 (the Act) and Financial Reporting Standards in Singapore;</li><br/>
  <li>For devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets;</li><br/>
  <li>To provide us with:<br/>
    <ol type="i" class="left-left" style="margin-left: -20%;">
      <li>Access to all information of which [management] is aware that is relevant to the preparation of the financial statements such as records, documentation and other matters, whether obtained from within or outside of the general and subsidiary ledgers (including all information relevant to the preparation of disclosures), and any other information management intends to issue; </li><br/>
      <li>Additional information that we may request from [management] for the purpose of the audit;</li><br/>
      <li>Unrestricted access to persons within the entity from whom we determine it necessary to obtain audit evidence; and</li><br/>
      <li>Sufficient time to allow us to complete the audit in accordance with the proposed timetable</li><br/>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<br/>
<span>As part of our audit process, we will request from management and those charged with governance, written confirmation concerning representations made to us in connection with the audit.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span>We look forward to full cooperation from your staff during our audit.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<i>Other relevant information</i>
<br/>
<br/>
<span>Our fees, which will be billed as work progresses, are based on the time required by the individuals assigned to the engagement plus expenses. Invoices will be sent and payments are due upon presentation.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span>We will notify you promptly of any circumstances we encounter that could significantly affect our estimate and discuss with you any additional fees, as necessary. Additional services provided beyond the described scope of services will be billed separately.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span>When we become aware of identified or suspected non-compliance with laws and regulations, including fraud, we will bring such matters to the attention of the appropriate level of management. If we become aware of fraud involving management or fraud involving employees who have significant roles in internal control, we will report this matter directly to those charged with governance. We will communicate with those charged with governance matters involving non-compliance with laws and regulations, including fraud that come to our attention unless they are clearly inconsequential. However, we will not communicate non-compliance matters, including fraud to the extent we are prohibited to do so by law or regulation.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<span>Please sign and return the attached copy of this letter to indicate your acknowledgement of, and agreement with, the arrangements for our audit of the financial statements including our respective responsibilities.</span>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span>Yours faithfully</span><br/><br/>
